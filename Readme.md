Simple JavaScript Carousel
A lightweight, responsive, and easy-to-use image carousel built from scratch using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is a great way to understand the fundamentals of DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS transitions without relying on any external libraries like jQuery or Swiper.js.

## Features
Autoplay: The carousel automatically cycles through slides.

Pause on Hover: Autoplay intelligently pauses when the user's mouse is over the carousel and resumes when it leaves.

Vanilla JavaScript: No dependencies or frameworks needed.

Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes.

Arrow Navigation: Includes "Next" and "Previous" buttons.

Dot Indicators: Allows users to jump to any specific slide.

Smooth Animations: Utilizes CSS transitions for a fluid sliding effect.

Easy to Customize: The code is well-commented and structured for easy modification.

## Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure of the carousel.

CSS3: For styling, layout (Flexbox), and animations.

JavaScript (ES6): For all the interactive logic and DOM manipulation.
